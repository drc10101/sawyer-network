Sawyer — Distributed MoE Inference Network.

The load is split. Friends help.

Sawyer distributes Mixture-of-Experts model inference across a network of
volunteer-hosted nodes. Each node hosts one or more expert weight files, and
a central router activates only the relevant experts per token. Users pay a
low monthly subscription ($5/mo) for a token budget — cheap enough to
experiment, paid enough to sustain the network. Hosts earn credits
proportional to compute contributed.

Trust is provided by Bedrock: cryptographic node identity, consent-gated
routing, and a tamper-evident audit chain.
