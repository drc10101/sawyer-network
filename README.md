# Sawyer — Distributed MoE Inference Network

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sawyer-core?color=%2312c7ef&label=pypi%3A%20sawyer-core)](https://pypi.org/project/sawyer-core/)

> **Status: Active prototype** — Provider onboarding and APIs are evolving. Sawyer is under active development toward an alpha milestone.

**"The load is split. Friends help."**

Named for Tom Sawyer, who turned an impossible chore into a community effort by making participation irresistible. Sawyer turns GPU inference — a credit-draining trap — into a distributed network where each node carries a piece of the load, and everyone benefits.

**Sawyer does not require providers to host full models.** Providers host isolated MoE expert workloads that the router activates only when needed. That is why Sawyer is not just another distributed inference project — it distributes only the sparse, independently activated sub-networks that MoE architectures make possible.

Built on [Bedrock](https://github.com/drc10101/bedrock) for node identity, consent-gated routing, and auditability. Sawyer runs on Bedrock. Sawyer does not own Bedrock.

## Use Cases

### For the Developer with a Laptop

You're building an app that calls LLM APIs. GPT-4 costs $0.03/1K tokens. Claude Haiku is cheaper but still adds up. Sawyer gives you a 14-day free trial with unlimited tokens — roughly $0.0075/1K tokens at Pro — with chat and code models available from day one.

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
pip install sawyer-core
sawyer run                       # One command, everything starts
sawyer run glm-5.1:cloud         # Pick a model
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
pip install sawyer-core
sawyer run                       # One command, everything starts
sawyer run glm-5.1:cloud         # Pick a model
```

No GPU required. Your laptop connects to the network and inference happens on nodes that have the hardware. You just type.

### For the Gamer with a 4090

Your gaming rig sits idle most of the day. Sawyer puts those GPUs to work. You host expert weights and serve inference to the network. The more you contribute, the more you earn -- your 4090 on Tier 4 earns 4x what a laptop on Tier 1 earns per token.

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
pip install sawyer-core
sawyer serve                   # Host experts, start earning
sawyer serve --model mixtral   # Pick a model to serve
sawyer status                  # Check your earnings
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
pip install sawyer-core
sawyer serve                   # Host experts, start earning
sawyer serve --model mixtral   # Pick a model to serve
sawyer status                  # Check your earnings
```

Tier 4 (24GB+ VRAM) can host any model's experts. Tier 1 (4GB) can still participate with Qwen1.5-MoE experts. Everyone earns.

### For the Small Team

Your startup needs inference but can't justify GPU costs. Subscribe at the Enterprise tier ($200/mo, 10M tokens) and route all your calls through Sawyer. Your inference cost drops by 3-6x compared to major API providers. No rate limits, no surprise bills.

### For the Hobbyist

You want to experiment with local models but only have one GPU. Sawyer lets you download experts, serve them locally or to the network, and use the chat client to interact. 14-day free trial, then Pro for $15/mo.

---

## How You Earn

Sawyer is not volunteer computing. You get paid for the compute you contribute.

### The Pool

Every quarter, 70% of all subscription revenue goes into the provider pool:

```
Provider Pool = Total Subscribers x Avg Subscription x 70%
```

With 100 Pro subscribers ($15/mo):
- Revenue: $1,500/month ($4,500/quarter)
- Provider pool: $3,150/quarter
- Platform: $1,350/quarter

With 1,000 subscribers:
- Revenue: $15,000/month ($45,000/quarter)
- Provider pool: $31,500/quarter
- Platform: $13,500/quarter

The pool grows as the network grows. More subscribers means more money for everyone.

### Distribution

The pool is split two ways:

| Share | What | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| 90% | Throughput | Tokens served x tier multiplier — the work you do |
| 10% | Uptime | Just being available matters, even if traffic is low |

### Hardware Tiers

Your earnings depend on what you bring to the network. A 4090 earns more per token than a 1060 because it can host larger, more valuable experts.

| Tier | VRAM | Multiplier | Can Host | Monthly Estimate* |
|------|------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | 4 GB | 1x | Qwen1.5-MoE experts (0.5 GB) | $15-50 |
| Tier 2 | 8 GB | 2x | + DeepSeek-V2 experts (0.8 GB) | $40-120 |
| Tier 3 | 12 GB | 3x | + Mixtral experts (1.5 GB) | $80-250 |
| Tier 4 | 24 GB+ | 4x | All experts, local models | $200-800+ |

*Estimates based on 100 Pro subscribers at $15/mo, varies with network size and utilization.

**Same 100K tokens served:**
- Tier 1 laptop: 100K x 1x = 100K weighted
- Tier 4 monster: 100K x 4x = 400K weighted

The monster PC earns 4x for the same token count because it invested in hardware that can do more for the network.

### Example: The Kid with the Monster PC

100 subscribers, one quarter:

| Provider | Tokens | Uptime | Tier | Weighted | Token Earnings | Uptime Earnings | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Monster PC (4090) | 500K | 720h | Tier 4 (4x) | 2,000,000 | $2,678 | $105 | **$2,783** |
| Gaming rig (3060) | 200K | 500h | Tier 3 (3x) | 600,000 | $803 | $72 | **$875** |
| Midrange (1060) | 50K | 300h | Tier 1 (1x) | 50,000 | $67 | $44 | **$111** |

The kid with the 4090 doing most of the work gets the biggest slice. That's the point.

### Payouts

- Quarterly: January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December
- Minimum payout: $10. Below that, your earnings roll over to next quarter
- Methods: Stripe Connect (primary), PayPal
- Failed payouts roll over — nobody loses money
- **Providers must complete Stripe Connect onboarding to receive payouts.** Earnings accumulate but cannot be disbursed until Stripe onboarding is complete. Run `sawyer provider onboarding <id>` to get started.

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | Tokens | Per 1K Tokens | Best For |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Explorer | 14-day free trial | Unlimited | $0.00 | Try it out |
| Pro | $15/mo | 2M | $0.0075 | Development, production workloads |
| Pioneer | $40/mo | 5M | $0.008 | Scale, growing teams |
| Enterprise | $200/mo | 10M | $0.020 | Teams, custom deployment |

14-day free trial with unlimited tokens. Then pick your plan. 70% of subscription revenue goes to the hosts who serve inference — real money attracts real hardware.

~3-6x cheaper than GPT-4. No rate limits. No surprise bills. Token budget resets monthly, unused tokens roll over (max 1 month).

---

## Supported Models

Use `sawyer models` to list available models, or filter by use case:

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
sawyer models              # All models
sawyer models --use chat   # Chat-focused models
sawyer models --use code   # Code-focused models
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
sawyer models              # All models
sawyer models --use chat   # Chat-focused models
sawyer models --use code   # Code-focused models
```

| Model | Params | Experts | Active/Token | Q4 Size | Expert Size | Best For |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Mixtral 8x7B | 46.7B | 8 | 2 | ~24 GB | ~1.5 GB | Chat, Code |
| DeepSeek-V2 Lite | 15.7B | 64 | 6 | ~9 GB | ~0.8 GB | Chat |
| Qwen1.5-MoE | 14.3B | 60 | 4 | ~7 GB | ~0.5 GB | Chat (lightweight) |
| DBRX Instruct | 132B | 16 | 4 | ~65 GB | ~2.5 GB | Code |

## Architecture

```
[User/Client]
     |
     v
[Sawyer Router]  <-- Bedrock identity, consent-gated routing
     |
     +--> [Node: Expert 0]  (RTX 4090, Dallas)     Tier 4 - 4x earnings
     +--> [Node: Expert 2]  (A100, Frankfurt)       Tier 4 - 4x earnings
     +--> [Node: Expert 5]  (RTX 3060, Tokyo)       Tier 3 - 3x earnings
     +--> [Node: Expert 7]  (GTX 1060, Sao Paulo)   Tier 1 - 1x earnings
     |
     v
[Aggregated Output] --> User
```

Every node earns proportional to its hardware contribution. The 4090 in Dallas earns 4x per token because it can host the experts the network needs most.

## Core Modules

### 1. `sawyer/router/` — Expert Router
- Receives token embeddings from the user's local dense layers
- Routes to the correct expert(s) based on the model's gating network
- Aggregates expert outputs, returns to user
- Tracks latency per node, falls back to redundant experts on timeout

### 2. `sawyer/node/` — Node Agent
- Registers with the network via Bedrock node identity
- Advertises capabilities: GPU model, VRAM, bandwidth, latency
- Hosts one or more expert weight files
- Serves inference requests via encrypted gRPC/QUIC
- Reports health and throughput to the router

### 3. `sawyer/token/` — Token Economics
- 14-day free trial with unlimited tokens, no credit card
- Pro tier at $15/mo gives 2M tokens, Enterprise at $200/mo gives 10M
- Tokens debit per inference request (input + output tokens)
- Token budget resets monthly, rolls over unused tokens (max 1 month)
- Provider pool = 70% of all subscription revenue distributed quarterly

### 4. `sawyer/provider/` — Provider Economics & Dashboard
- **Node Tiers**: 4 hardware tiers (4GB/8GB/12GB/24GB+) with 1x-4x earnings multipliers
- **Revenue Pool**: 70% of subscription revenue distributed to providers quarterly
- **Quarterly Payout**: Pool split by weighted contribution, $25 minimum, Stripe/PayPal
- **Rollover**: Below-threshold earnings carry forward — nobody loses money
- **Dashboard**: Real-time web UI at `http://localhost:8000/` when serving — see tokens served, earnings, uptime, model breakdown, daily/weekly stats

### 5. `sawyer/identity/` — Bedrock Integration
- Every node holds a Bedrock cryptographic identity
- Router verifies node certificates before routing
- Consent tokens gate which models a node will serve
- Audit chain logs every inference request for compliance

### 6. `sawyer/model/` — Model Registry
- Catalog of supported MoE models tagged by use case (chat, code)
- Expert weight files versioned and checksummed
- Nodes download experts on registration or on-demand
- Supports Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2, Qwen MoE, DBRX

---

## Protocol

```
1. Node registers with Sawyer network
   --> Bedrock identity issued (certificate, scope, audit chain)
   --> Node advertises: GPU, VRAM, bandwidth, experts available
   --> Tier classification: Tier 1-4 based on VRAM

2. User sends inference request
   --> Sawyer router authenticates user (token balance check)
   --> Router runs gating network locally to select experts
   --> Router sends expert activation request to node(s)
   --> Node validates consent token, runs expert forward pass
   --> Node returns expert output, logs to audit chain
   --> Router aggregates, returns to user
   --> Token balance debited

3. Quarterly settlement
   --> Provider pool = 70% of all subscription revenue
   --> 90% distributed by weighted throughput (tokens x tier multiplier)
   --> 10% distributed by uptime
   --> Payouts >= $25 via Stripe Connect
   --> Below $25 rolls over to next quarter
```

## Installation

**Requires Python 3.11 or later.**

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
pip install sawyer-core
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
pip install sawyer-core
```

For GPU inference (hosting expert nodes):

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
pip install sawyer-core[inference]
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
pip install "sawyer-core[inference]"
```

Note: `vllm` and `llama-cpp-python` require CUDA and a C++ compiler. If installation fails, install them separately following their docs, then install sawyer-core without extras.

Or install from source for development:

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/drc10101/sawyer-network.git
cd sawyer-network
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/drc10101/sawyer-network.git
cd sawyer-network
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running

After install, Sawyer can be run either way:

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
sawyer serve                # if Python Scripts is on PATH
python -m sawyer serve      # works everywhere, no PATH needed
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
sawyer serve                # if Python Scripts is on PATH
python -m sawyer serve      # works everywhere, no PATH needed
```

### One Command to Start Everything

`sawyer run` starts Ollama (if needed), the Sawyer router, and your agent -- one command, entire workflow:

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
sawyer run                        # Auto-detect best model, start everything
sawyer run glm-5.1:cloud          # Use a specific model
sawyer run --no-agent             # Start Sawyer only, don't launch agent
sawyer run --no-browser           # Don't open browser
sawyer run --agent cursor         # Launch Cursor instead of Hermes
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
sawyer run                        # Auto-detect best model, start everything
sawyer run glm-5.1:cloud          # Use a specific model
sawyer run --no-agent             # Start Sawyer only, don't launch agent
sawyer run --no-browser           # Don't open browser
sawyer run --agent cursor         # Launch Cursor instead of Hermes
```

What `sawyer run` does:
1. Detects Ollama -- starts it if not running
2. Discovers models -- lists what's available with sizes
3. Starts Sawyer router -- OpenAI-compatible API on port 8000
4. Prints config -- exact copy-paste lines for your agent
5. Opens browser -- chat UI at `http://localhost:8000`
6. Launches agent -- Hermes by default, configurable via `--agent`

If you just want the chat UI and API:

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
sawyer chat                    # Web UI + OpenAI-compatible API
sawyer chat --ollama-bridge    # Also serve local Ollama to the network
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
sawyer chat                    # Web UI + OpenAI-compatible API
sawyer chat --ollama-bridge    # Also serve local Ollama to the network
```

### Provider Dashboard

When serving, Sawyer hosts a real-time dashboard at `http://localhost:8000/`. You'll see:

- **Daily token chart** — bar graph of tokens served over the last 7 days
- **Weekly summary** — total tokens, earnings, uptime, average daily tokens
- **Daily breakdown table** — date, tokens, requests, latency, uptime, earnings, errors
- **Model breakdown** — which models you served tokens for
- **Expert breakdown** — which expert shards you ran
- **Tier badge** — your hardware tier and earnings multiplier (1x-4x)
- **Payout info** — available balance, total earned, total paid, next payout date

API endpoints for programmatic access:

```
GET /api/stats              — JSON stats for the current provider
GET /api/stats/{id}         — JSON stats for a specific provider
```

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

### One-Click Install (Windows)

Double-click `sawyer.bat` in the repo, or run the PowerShell installer for a desktop shortcut and Start Menu entry:

```powershell
irm https://infill.systems/install/sawyer.ps1 | iex
```

To uninstall: `.\install_sawyer.ps1 -Uninstall`

---

## Why It Works

- **MoE is more distributable than dense inference.** Experts are independent sub-networks. Unlike tensor parallelism (which splits a single matrix across GPUs), each expert runs its own forward pass. MoE is more distributable than dense tensor-parallel inference because experts are independently activated, but Sawyer's core engineering challenge is keeping routing, expert execution, and aggregation fast enough to feel local.
- **Sparsity means efficiency.** Only ~25% of parameters activate per token on Mixtral. The network doesn't pay for dormant compute.
- **Quantized models fit on consumer hardware.** Q4_K_M Mixtral expert ~1.5GB. A 3090 can host 2-3 experts comfortably alongside other workloads.
- **14-day free trial removes the barrier.** Developers try without commitment. $15/mo Pro is the real entry point — high enough to fund real host payouts, low enough to beat every major API.
- **Hardware investment is rewarded.** Tier 4 (24GB+) earns 4x per token compared to Tier 1 (4GB). Your 4090 pays for itself.

## Agent Integration

Sawyer exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Any agent framework that supports custom OpenAI base URLs can use Sawyer as its LLM backend -- no SDK changes needed.

### Quick Start

**bash / Git Bash:**
```bash
sawyer run                    # Starts Ollama + Sawyer + Hermes
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
sawyer run                    # Starts Ollama + Sawyer + Hermes
```
